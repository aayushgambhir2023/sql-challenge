In this simulated scenario as a data engineer at Pewlett Hackard, I embarked on a comprehensive project that spanned data modeling, engineering, and analysis. First, I meticulously examined six CSV files, crafting an Entity Relationship Diagram to guide the subsequent steps. Moving to the data engineering phase, I carefully designed table schemas, considering data types, primary keys, foreign keys, and other constraints. The challenge involved ensuring the uniqueness of primary keys and establishing proper relationships between tables. Finally, in the data analysis segment, SQL queries were crafted to extract valuable information, ranging from employee details and department managers to specific criteria like hiring dates and departmental affiliations. This exercise provided a holistic experience, mirroring the diverse responsibilities a data engineer might encounter in a real-world setting.
